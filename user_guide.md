# Quickstart Guide
## Microscope startup and initialisation

1. Boot the software by running the `interface_run_me.py` script. **ENSURE the power to the motors is OFF**.
2. Once provided a `Enter command` promt, turn on the motor power at the controller switch.
3. Type 

# Control Notes

The primary form of interaction with the microscope is via the command line interface. This will change over time to a Graphical User Interface, but the command line interface will always be accessible for debugging and convenience.

## How To Use Commands
All commands can be passed arguments in the form of characters separated by `<space>` keys. For instance, `sl` is the "go to laser wavelenght command", and it requires a laser wavelength as a number for it's argument. The command to move to 750 nm laser excitation is `sl 750`.

### Frequent Commands
- `wai`: "whera am I" prints the current motor positions and calculates the laser and grating wavelengths using the calibrations
- `sl` $\lambda$: set laser wavelength to specified value (e.g. `sl 800` for 800 nm)
- `sg` $\lambda$: set wavelength on all gratings (microscope filter and double monochromator)
- `sm` $\lambda$: set wavelength on just the monochromator gratings. Useful for moving the dection closer to the laser line (for seeing low-frequency modes) or further from the laser line (to reduce stray light and rayleigh scattering signal)
- `st` $\lambda$: set TIRAX spectrometer wavelength
- `sall` $\lambda$: set all wavelengths (for changing the whole setup to a specific wavelength)

- `reference` $\lambda$: reassigns the current motor positions to the wavelength of choice. Used when making minor adjustments to the alignment of the laser or gratings.

- `run`: runs the camera in continuous acquisition mode. Data is plotted to the data_viewer_run_me.py
-`stop`: stops a continuous acquisition.
- `filename` $string$: sets the current filename ($string$) for saved data
- `gui`: brings up the GUI for preparing and performing multidimensional scan datasets

- `enable`: cycles through the startup sequences of the laser. Reperated calls to `enable` progress the startup sequence:
    1. Checks the warmup start and initiates diode warmup
    2. Enables the laser at non-lasing power (0.05 W) for second warmup.
    3. Turns the laser to 4.0 W - laser is fully on, but shutter is closed still
- `shutteron`: opens the laser shutter
- `shutteroff`: closes the shutter
- `cycleshutter`: closes then reopens the shutter. Useful for startup because the shutter sometimes doesn't open when it should

### Individual Motor Motion
Sometimes you need to jog the motors a small number of steps, for alignment or for calibration. This is done by typing the motor label and the number of steps you want to move (relative motion not absolute), either positive or negative direction.

- `l1` $x$: move laser motor 1 $x$ steps
- `l2` $x$: move laser motor 2 $x$ steps
- `l3` $x$: move laser motor 3 $x$ steps
- `g1` $x$: move grating motor 1 $x$ steps
- `g2` $x$: move grating motor 2 $x$ steps
- `g3` $x$: move grating motor 3 $x$ steps
- `g4` $x$: move grating motor 4 $x$ steps
