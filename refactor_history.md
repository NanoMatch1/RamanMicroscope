# Raman Microscope Refactoring History

## Communication Protocol Update (2025-03-31)

### Summary of Changes

We've refactored the motion control system to work with a new Arduino firmware communication protocol. The key improvements include:

1. **Dictionary-based motor references** - Motors are now referenced by human-readable labels ('l1', 'g1', etc.) rather than fixed indices, making the code more maintainable and intuitive.

2. **Unified command format** - The Arduino now uses a consistent command format with delimiters (e.g., 'g...g' for position queries, 'o...o' for movement commands), improving protocol clarity.

3. **Flattened motor map** - Created a consolidated `motor_map` for direct lookup of any motor by its label.

4. **Improved error handling** - Added proper error reporting in motion control functions rather than silently ignoring errors.

5. **Action group organization** - Motors are organized by functional groups (e.g., 'laser_wavelength', 'monochromator_wavelength'), making it easier to manage related motors.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Dictionary-based positions** - Motor positions are now stored as dictionaries mapping motor labels to positions, rather than fixed-length lists. This allows more flexible expansion.

2. **Calibration interface** - Designed the system to use a generalized calibration service with a `wl_to_steps` method that returns motor positions for a given wavelength.

3. **Backward compatibility** - Where needed, we maintained backward compatibility for existing code while transitioning to the new approach.

4. **Improved error handling** - Added proper validation and error reporting throughout the motion control system.

5. **Prefer straightforward solutions** - Minimized complexity and over-engineering, focusing on readability and robustness.

### Code Style Guidelines

1. **Descriptive docstrings** - Every function should have a clear docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values.

2. **Limited comments** - Code should be self-documenting with good function and variable names. Comments are used sparingly for complex logic.

3. **Robustness** - Functions validate inputs and handle errors with informative messages.

4. **Dictionary-based approach** - Prefer dictionaries with meaningful keys over fixed positional lists or arrays.

### Remaining Work

1. Complete refactoring of remaining motion control functions for other components

2. Update the calibration service to support the dictionary-based approach

3. Implement proper error handling for Arduino communication
 
4. Update any functions dependent on the old motor position format

5. Thoroughly test all refactored functionality

### Architecture Notes

- The Microscope class is the primary coordinator that uses MotionControl for hardware interactions
- Motor IDs in action_groups allow for flexible reassignment of physical motors
- The interface is designed to be modular, allowing different hardware components to be swapped out
