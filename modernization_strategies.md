# Raman Microscope Modernization Strategies

## Current Architecture Analysis

The Microscope class currently serves as a central hub that:
- Manages calibration data
- Controls all hardware components
- Handles command routing
- Stores state information (positions, wavelengths)
- Provides UI-callable functions

This creates several challenges:
- High coupling between components
- Difficulty in simulation without actual hardware
- Complex state management across instruments
- Calibration data centralized rather than component-specific

## Modularization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Domain-Driven Equipment Classes

Create comprehensive equipment classes that own their domain-specific:
- Calibration data
- State information
- Movement logic
- Safety constraints

Each instrument would:
- Store its own calibration parameters
- Convert between physical units and device units internally
- Manage its own state

**Implementation approach**:
- Extend existing Laser, Spectrometer, etc. classes
- Move relevant calibration objects into each class
- Create interfaces for cross-component communication
- Define clear component boundaries

### Strategy 2: Calibration Service Pattern

Create a dedicated CalibrationService that:
- Functions as a separate service class
- Manages all calibration data
- Provides conversion methods to instruments
- Maintains calibration files
- Handles calibration updates

Each instrument would:
- Request calibration data when needed
- Focus purely on hardware control
- Be unaware of other components

### Strategy 3: Mediator-Based Architecture

Redesign Microscope as a true mediator that:
- Coordinates between independent instrument objects
- Doesn't store state directly
- Routes commands and information
- Manages relationships rather than implementations

Equipment classes would:
- Be fully autonomous
- Communicate via the mediator
- Own their calibration and state

### Strategy 4: Event-Driven System

Implement an event-based system where:
- Components publish state changes
- Interested components subscribe to relevant events
- Microscope becomes an orchestrator rather than controller
- Calibration events trigger appropriate reactions

This approach would reduce direct dependencies while maintaining system coordination.

## Recommended Implementation

A hybrid approach of Strategies 2 and 3 would be most effective:

1. Create a dedicated CalibrationService
2. Refactor instrument classes to own their domain-specific functions
3. Transform Microscope into a mediator/coordinator
4. Use dependency injection for flexible component substitution

This approach would:
- Improve separation of concerns
- Enable better simulation through polymorphism
- Reduce the complexity of the Microscope class
- Make the system more maintainable and testable

## Simulation Improvements

1. SimulatedLaser
   - Simulate wavelength changes
   - Return realistic power levels
   - Maintain internal state for position

2. SimulatedMonochromator
   - Simulate wavelength adjustments
   - Model filter changes
   - Simulate grating movements

3. SimulatedStageControl
   - Keep track of XYZ positions
   - Simulate stage movement delays
   - Provide position feedback

4. SimulatedMicroscope
   - Act as coordinator between simulated components
   - Maintain simulated calibration data
   - Process commands identically to real hardware

The simulation should maintain proper relationships between components, e.g., when laser wavelength changes, appropriate shifts should propagate through the system.
